# Howdy, Internet Traveler! Welcome to My Quirky GitHub Universe! 🚀

## I'm Eduardo, and I'm Stoked You Stopped By! 👋

Hailing from the spirited lands of southern Brazil since 1998, I've been on a wild ride mixing a cocktail of art, science, philosophy, and religion. Imagine me as an alchemist, but instead of lead into gold, I'm turning coffee into code and electric currents into... well, more organized electric currents.

## 🌱 Currently Juggling These Hot Potatoes

- 👨🏻‍💻 Linux (Yes, I'm fashionably late to the party 😅).

## 📖 Superpowers

- ⚡ Electricity and Electronics (Shocking, I know).
- 🔢 Math (especially when it gets all calculus-y).
- 🍽 Gourmet Wizardry (Yep, I'm a chef too. Bet you didn’t see that coming).


## 👾 What Keeps Me Sane?

- 🚗 Street Car Racing (Not to Fast but really Furious vibes).
- 🎮 Gaming (Apex Legends, NFS Heat... pwned much?).
- 🛸 Stargazing (Always ready for a close encounter).
  
>"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science. He to whom the emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand wrapped in awe, is as good as dead — his eyes are closed. The insight into the mystery of life, coupled though it be with fear, has also given rise to religion. To know what is impenetrable to us really exists, manifesting itself as the highest wisdom and the most radiant beauty, which our dull faculties can comprehend only in their most primitive forms — this knowledge, this feeling is at the center of true religiousness." — Albert Einstein

Stay curious, stay weird, and may the source be with you! 🌟
